# wordNebula
## Introduction
I am a casual reader and the occasional writer of my thoughts. I honestly do not publish anything. This project came about after reading and seeing videos of George R. R. Martin using a word processor that requires DOS to run. After doing some research, I saw these terminal-based word processors still exist. From what I could find out, they still exist due to the fact that professional writers prefer a distraction-free writing environment.

The goal of this project is implement a word processor that focuses having a distraction free environment.

## Software Tools
- VSCode
- CMake
- Devcontainer (for developing in consistent environment across my different computers)
